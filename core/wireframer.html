===== WIREFRAMER Tailwind UI CONTEXT =====

This file contains a dotnet vite react wireframe UI built with Tailwind 5.3.x. It can be modified
based on user instructions to create various UI components and layouts.

Modification Guidelines:
1. Components: 
  - Add/modify Tailwind components (navbar, cards, modals, etc.) as requested
  - Use Tailwind utilities for spacing, colors, and layout
  - Ensure components maintain responsive behavior

2. Layout Considerations:
  - Use Tailwind's grid system for responsive layouts
  - Maintain mobile-first approach
  - Use appropriate breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl, xxl) for responsive design

3. Styling:
  - Prefer Tailwind classes over custom CSS when possible
  - Add custom CSS only when necessary
  - Maintain consistent spacing, typography, and color schemes

4. JavaScript:
  - Hook up interactive elements with proper event listeners
  - Use Tailwind's JavaScript components when available
  - Keep scripts organized and well-commented

5. Accessibility:
  - Use semantic HTML elements
  - Include appropriate ARIA attributes
  - Ensure proper contrast and focus states

For additional modifications or features, just describe what you need in plain language.
